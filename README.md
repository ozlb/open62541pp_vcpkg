# Prebuilt open62541pp vcpkg Artifacts

This repository provides **precompiled vcpkg artifacts** for the
[open62541pp](https://github.com/open62541pp/open62541pp) library.

The goal is to make it easy to download ready‑to‑use static builds for:

- **Windows (x64-windows-static)**
- **Linux (x64-linux)**  
  (static `.a` libraries produced by vcpkg)

These builds are generated automatically using GitHub Actions.

---

## 📦 What’s included

Each artifact contains the full vcpkg installation folder for the selected triplet:

```
include/
lib/
share/
tools/
```

This means you can drop the folder directly into your project or point your
build system to it.

1. Go to the **Actions** tab of this repository  
2. Select the workflow run you want (Windows or Linux)
